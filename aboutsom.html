             <p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) in India has seen significant interest for several years as NGOs, companies, social workers and scientific authors are involved in working towards betterment of the underprivileged section of the society. India is the first country in the world to make corporate social responsibility (CSR) mandatory, following an amendment to the Companies Act, 2013. Businesses need to donate 2% of their profits in areas such as education, poverty alleviation, gender equality, health, hunger and many more as part of the CSR compliance.</p>
             <p>In India the corneal blind population accounts to 1.1 million people. Yet there is no significant
                volunteering to pledge and donate eyes to the blind.
                
                The following points could be the reasons for not donating the eyes after demise of a person:
                
                1-Taking the courage to speak to the family about the eye donation in the event of demise of a
                person.
                2-Due to the wrong belief that donation of eyes could lead to blindness in the next incarnation of
                the person.
                3-A wrong notion that “If I pledge today what would be the chances of donation at a distant and
                uncertain day of demise”Lack of voluntary initiative for pledging of eyes.
                The decision to donate eyes must come from oneself.

                It is known and understandable situation that in the event of demise of a person, the family and friends would be in deep pain. Hence the initiation to donate eyes from the family becomes difficult. In such a scenario what is the solution or approach to donate eyes? Even the pain in the life of a person due to blindness is unacceptable by humanity.
                
                In such an instance a person himself or herself must decide that they would want to donate their eyes after their life term</p>                <p>The youth population in general is full of energy. The age and energy levels are such that it would achieve anything in life. Such is the motivation levels. But when a person experiences change with time from youth to adult, adult to a family of his own and then from family life to old age, the Interests, Motivation and Energy Levels, Priorities will change.

                    We humans are social animals. We live in a society where people are different in various ways.</p><br>          </div>

            <div>
                <p> The majority (96.8%) of students knew that eyes can be donated after death but only 38.2% knew that the ideal time of donation was within 6 hours of death. Most participants (85.1%) were either willing or had already donated their eyes. Nobility in the act of eye donation was the main motivational force for eye donation according to 85.6% of students. Perceived reasons for not pledging eyes by the students were: the unacceptable idea of separating the eyes from the body (67.9%), lack of awareness (42.8%), objection by family members (28.5%), and unsuitability to donate because of health problem (10.7%).</p>
            
            <p>This study revealed that nursing students were well aware of eye donations and most of them were inclined to sign-up for eye donation. The perceived reasons for not donating eyes need to be considered while creating awareness about eye donation in the community. The nursing students could be actively involved as volunteers in eye donation campaigns and they can act as counsellors for eye donors. They can also contribute by participating in creating awareness and motivating people to become eye donors.
